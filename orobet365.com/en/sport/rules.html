      On the site you will find the following types of bets:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>«<b>Single bet</b>» – bet, predicting the outcome of one event. Payout for a "single bet" is equal to the sum of the bet multiplied by the winning coefficient.</li>
      <li>«<b>Express bet</b>» – bet on the outcome of several events that do not depend on each other. The payment at the Express bet is equal to the product of the
        coefficients of each event multiplied by the bet size. In the "Express" can be included several unrelated events, any kind of sport. The express bet is counted (it
        is considered a winning one) if all the selected events were correctly anticipated. In the event that at least one event was not predicted correctly, the bet is
        considered to be a losing one.
      </li>
      <li>«<b>System</b>» – full combination of "Expresses" of a single size, chosen by the bettor. Payout for "System" is equal to the amount of payments for "Express",
        included in the "System".

      <li>«<b>Live </b>– bet» - a bet on the main or additional outcome made during the event.</li>
      <li>«<b>Handicap</b>» - providing a virtual advantage, or vice versa easing. That is, if the outcome of the match is predictable, since one of the teams has a clear
        advantage, the user can bet the weaker team, thereby adding to it the number of virtual goals that he chooses. If the handicap is + 1 - one goal, H + 2 - 2 goals
        and so on. Thus, the match for the user will start if the user puts on the handicap+3 for a certain team, the game will start with a score of 3: 0 in favor of the
        selected team. Such a bet is considered to be winning if the selected team won regarding a handicap. In case of a tie, the bet is considered to be a losing bet.
      </li>
      <li>«<b>Total</b>» - is the bet on the total number of goals scored, points scored, played games in the match. The total can have two positions - more or less than the
        selected number. The bet will be returned if the number coincides with the total.
      </li>
      <li>«<b>Bet on time </b>» - a betting, which consists in the fact that the event will occur at the time specified by the user. For example, the time of the first goal,
        the first corner, and so on. Time for payments at these rates will be determined without taking into account the seconds.
        The Company has the right to set the maximum or minimum amount of the bet on any event or any type of bet.
        The victory of the first participant of the event is designated as W1, the tie is designated as X, the victory of the second participant is marked as W2. It is
        possible to make a bet (double chance) for two outcomes of the events at the same time, for example, that the first team will not lose, that is, either it will win

        invalid; the organizer will notify the user through changes in the program or through other sources of information.
        Users who participate in a particular event can not bet on it. (Here: coach, player, referee, club owner, etc.). When making a bet, the user confirms that he does
        not know the outcome of the event, to which he concludes a bet with the BM. If this rule is violated, the rate will be declared invalid, and the company may cancel
        the winnings.
      </li>
      <li>All bets that have been declared invalid will be returned to the user's account. In case an invalid bet was included in the Express or System, the winnings will be
        calculated with a coefficient of "1"
      </li>
      <li>Bets are accepted on the basis of the Line, where the Line is a list of bets on certain events, with winning odds, limited by the maximum bets for betting. Each
        event is assigned a number, the last date and the length of time during which it is possible to make bets on this event. The time and date of the beginning of the
        event are purely informative. The wrong date and time are not the reason for the cancellation of the bid. If the event took place later than indicated, the bet is
        considered valid. In case the bet was made after the actual start of the event, the bet will be declared invalid. The calculation of bets is made exclusively
        according to the time of the actual start of the event, declared by the organizer.
      </li>
      <li>In the Event section, the names of the commands or events to which the user can bet are displayed. The first place on the list is the team on the field of which the
        game is played, then the outcome of the event, odds, handicaps, totals. Also, other information that are of great importance in the course may be indicated. In case
        the match is played on the team's field, which is listed as the second, the bet will be calculated with a coefficient of "1" except the cases when:
        <p>- Both teams participating in the match are from one city;</p>
        <p>- Games are held in the same city, or in one country, if the tournament is international;</p>
        <p>- If this event is the final round of the cup games of the country.</p>
        The bet will be considered valid if the match has been moved to a neutral field.
      </li>
      <li>The order of opponents in individual tennis tournaments or matches of the final stage of major tournaments can be arbitrary.</li>
      <li>The already started events may not be completed or suspended for certain reasons. The event will be considered to be held, if interrupted, it was not finished in 24
        hours, and the time before the break was:
        <p>football - 70 minutes;</p>
        <p>Basketball NBA - 40 minutes;</p>
        <p>European basketball - 35 minutes;</p>
        <p>hockey NHL - 54 minutes;</p>
        <p>Euro Hockey - 50 minutes;</p>
        <p>baseball (MLB) - 5 innings;</p>
        <p>American football - 50 minutes;</p>
        <p>hockey with the ball - 60 min.</p>
        In this case, the outcome of the event will be calculated in accordance with the moment when the event was interrupted.
        In other cases, the event will be declared invalid. Also for matches with an equal score of those sports, under the rules which can not be a draw (here: basketball,
        baseball, American football, NHL playoff series, etc.), in this situation all bets will be returned.
        In case the outcome of the event was uniquely determined at the moment when the event was interrupted and recognized as failed, the bet will be calculated.
        (For example: if the bet was made on the fact that in the first half, the W1 team will score two goals)
      </li>
      <li>If one or more matches in the bet on the statistics of the game day or tour did not take place, the winnings will be calculated with a coefficient of "1". The
        exception is those rates, the result of which is unambiguously determined, regardless of whether the matches took place.
        Let's consider an example:
        In the championship of Germany in Serie B in one of the rounds of 9 matches, 3 matches were not held, three games ended with the victory of the guests, two matches
        with the victory of the hosts and one match was over with a score of 3: 3.
        In case the rates were made as follows:
        <p>- on the tour there will be at least 3 matches with the victory of the hosts</p>
        <p>- Total goals scored on the tour will be odd</p>
        The bet will be calculated with a coefficient of "1"If the bet was on the following events:
        <p>- there will be a minimum of 2 guests wins;</p>
        <p>- there will be a match with the ending 3: 3;</p>
        then the bet will be considered a winning one.
        If the bet was made on the fact that for the whole tour there will be no match with the result of 3: 3, the bet is considered to be losing.
      </li>
      <li>Winning or losing bets that were made at the time of any software errors are not counted and are refundable to the user's account.</li>
      <li><b>Bets of Football</b>
        Football is a team sport which consists of 2 halves, each 45 minutes long (total 90 minutes).
        As a rule, the referee adds a certain time period to each of these halves, which is deemed part of these halves. The break after halves is 15 minutes. There are two
        teams participating in the game. Each team has 11 players including the goalkeeper. The game is held on a grass field. The game objective is to score a ball in the
        opponents' gates more times than the rival team. The ball can be moved with any part of the body, but not with the hands. The winner is the team which scores the
        most goals during the game. In case of a tie after both halves, these regulations will be applied :
        A draw is considered in case of tournaments or/and competitions where points are calculated: 3 points are given to the team for winning, 1 point for a draw, and no
        points for defeat. This result also applied to friendly matches.
        An additional overtime of 2 halves each 15 minutes long is assigned. In case of failure to decide the winner during the overtime, penalty shootouts are assigned to
        determine the winner of the match. This result can occur at stages of the tournaments/competitions where no points are awarded to the teams, and the objective is to
        determine the winner of the match and which team passes to the next stage of the tournament (e.g. 1/8 finals, 1/4 finals, 1/2 finals, finals, etc.), or which team
        becomes the final winner (if it wins in the finals).
        The teams can substitute players during the match. The fixed number of replacements for the official matches is 3, and for friendly matches that number can be
        increased by mutual agreement.
        <p><b>The “offside” position is considered if :</b></p>
        <p>• The player is on the rival’s part of the field.</p>
        <p>• The player is nearer to the opponent’s goal line than both the ball and the second-last opponent.</p>
        In case of violation of the game rules a caution is assigned. The yellow card is assigned in case of rough violations. The red card is assigned in case of the most
        flagrant violations. The player that received a red card is disqualified from the game. If the player breaks the rules on his/her team’s half of field, penalty
        shots are assigned in favor of the opposing team.
        In case the ball goes out of the field’s borders ("out), one of the team players can enter the ball into the game, if the last touch before the outbreak was
        committed by the opponent player.
      </li>
      <li><b> Bets on Tennis</b>
        In tennis there are 2 opportunity players (singles) or 2 teams of 2 players each (doubles). The tennis court is divided in two parts by a net stretched at a certain
        height across the court.
        A tournament consists of sets, sets include games and games have points. Players are located on opposite sides of the court. One player is designated the server and
        starts the game, with the opposing player as the receiver. The game objective is to send the ball over the net and into the opponent’s part of court in such a way
        that the opposing player cannot return the ball, though the ball must not go beyond the field. The opposing player must return the ball before it touches the ground
        more than once, and the ball can be returned without touching the ground. If the ball was twice served incorrectly (“double fault”), the opponent gets a point, and
        the score is 15-0. In case the ball was served wrongly once again, the score is 30-0, then 40-0, after which a won point means game won: 1-0. The score during the
        game can be 15-15, 30-15, 30-30, 40-30, etc. In case of a 40-40 tie in a game, it continues until one of the players gets 2 points ahead of the opponent. The score
        is calculated in numbers before 40. The first player to win 6 games (only if the opposing player won no more than 4 games) wins the set (e.g. 6:1, 6:2 etc.). If the
        game score is 5:5 one of the players must win the next two consecutive games (i.e. 7:5). If the game score is 6:6 (“tie break”), the game goes on until 7 points are
        won (but with an advantage of no less than 2 points, e.g. 7:5). If a player wins the tie-break, he/she wins the set with 7:6 score.
        The player that wins 2 sets (in all women’s competitions and most of men’s competitions) or 3 sets (in the most prestigious tournaments like the Grand Slam, Davis
        Cup) is considered the winner of the match. At the end of the most prestigious tournaments the decisive set (i.e. if the set score is 1:1 (for women) or 2:2 (for
        men)) tie-break is not played and the match continues until one of the players gets a 2 game advantage. Tennis is played on various courts, e.g. clay, grass courts.

        extra end(s) and the team who scores first wins the game. Each team uses a set of 8 stones per end, 16 stones in total are played during an end. When 16 stones have
        been played, points are counted. The winner is the team that puts a stone closest to the center of the house. That team gets a point for each stone that is closer
        to the center than an opponent’s closest stone.

      ELEVATED ODDS FOR EXPRESS BETTING
    </h4>
    <ol>
      <li>To increase the winning amount, the Company may establish additional multiplied rates for the Express bet, which corresponds to a number of requirements.</li>
      <li>Additional requirements may include some special rates, the minimum number of events in the Express, the minimum event ratio, or a combination of conditions.</li>
      <li>When the foreseen requirements are fulfilled, the user's bet win is multiplied by an additional multiplied coefficient in accordance with the conditions.</li>
      <li>For a number of fixed Express combinations, the Company can also set a fixed bet.
        <div><b>Example 1: </b>The company determined an additional multiplied coefficient 1.1 for an Express bet involving at least 10 events,
          as well as an additional multiplied coefficient 1.2 for an Express bet containing at least 4 events with a coefficient of at least 1.7.
        </div>
        &nbsp;
        <div style="margin-left: 25px;"><b>Option 1: </b>The user made up an Express containing 10 events with a total coefficient of 30. If this bet plays, the winnings
          will be multiplied by an additional coefficient of 1.1 (for example, if the bet was 10EUR, the final win makes 10x30 x 1.1 = 33EUR ).
        </div>
        &nbsp;
        <div style="margin-left: 25px;"><b>Option 2: </b>The user made up an Express bet containing 5 events with a coefficient of 2.0 for each event. The general
          coefficient of the Express is 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 = 32. If this bet wins, the win is multiplied by an additional coefficient of 1.2 (for example, if the bet was
          10 EUR, then the final win is 10 x 32 x 1.2 = 384 EUR).
        </div>
        &nbsp;
        <div style="margin-left: 25px;"><b>Option 3: </b>The user chose an Express bet containing 10 events with a coefficient of 2.0 for each event, the total ratio is 2 x
          2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 = 1024. This Express corresponds to both the first and second conditions. If this Express wins, the final win will be
          multiplied by an additional factor of 1.2 (for example, if the bet was 10 EUR, then the final win will be 10 x 1024 x 1.2 = 1.228.8 EUR).
        </div>
        &nbsp;
        <div><b>Example 2: </b>The organizing company offered an additional bonus on the Express from about 15 events with 10 EUR and noted that
          if the 15 events out of 15 are correctly predicted, the total coefficient will be 1000, if the predictions of the outcomes of 14 events are correct, the
          coefficient will be 600, and in case of correct forecasting of outcomes of 13 events, the coefficient will be 300. In case of incorrect forecasting of outcomes
          of 3 or more events, the Express is considered lost. The participant will receive 10 x 1000 = 10 000 in case of forecasting 15 events, in the case of
          forecasting 14 events, the sum will be 10x600 = 6000, and in case of forecasting 13 events - 10x300 = 3000EUR.

        coefficient may be applied. Thus, considering the additional multiplied factor (which is set by the Organizer), the final coefficient of this Express will be
        greater than the sum of the multiplied coefficients of the events participating in the Express.
      </li>
      <li>The "Top Express" events proposed by the organizing company can be selected from the number of both current and not yet started events.</li>
      <li>Several "Top Express" can act simultaneously.</li>
      <li>The number of participating in the "Top Express" outcomes of events is determined at the discretion of the Company.</li>
      <li>All changes from the participant of the bet entail the loss of an additional multiplied coefficient.</li>
      <li>The organizer has the right to set the time frame within which "Top Express" is possible. Such express can be added both to the site and to the Organizer system, or
        on the contrary it may be removed from the site and the system without prior notification.

        The additional multiplied coefficient for Top Express is 1.2, and the participant's bet is 10EUR.

        If the results of the three events coincide with the predicted outcomes, the player's winnings will be 10 x 1.5 x 3 x 2.5 x 1.2 = 135EUR, where 10 EUR is the bet of
        the participant, 1.5, 3 and 2.5 are the coefficients of the corresponding outcomes of the events, and 1.2 is the additional multiplied coefficient of Express. As it
        is seen from the example, the participant's bet is multiplied by the corresponding coefficients of all events and by an additional multiplied "Top Express"
        coefficient.
